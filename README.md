# Day 1 Progress

🔹 Backend Setup

Today I created a basic Express server and built two simple API endpoints:

GET /api/users – fetch all users
POST /api/users – create a new user

These APIs are only for testing to make sure the server is working correctly.

🔹 MongoDB Connection

I successfully connected the server to MongoDB using Mongoose.
The connection is stable and working fine.

🔹 Middleware

Added express.json() to read JSON body data.

Added CORS, so my frontend (like React) can communicate with the backend without issues.

🔹 Testing


Everything is working smoothly.
